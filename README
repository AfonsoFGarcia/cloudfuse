Cloudfuse is a FUSE application which provides access to Mosso's Cloud Files.

Cloud Files is a remote storage system which is similar in principle to
Amazon's S3.  It provides a simple RESTful interface to storing and retrieving
objects.

BUILDING:

    You'll need libcurl, fuse, and libxml2 (and possibly their dev packages)
    installed to build it.  If libmagic is available at compile time, it will
    be used to automatically determine content-types.
    Cloudfuse is built and installed like any other autoconf configured code.
    Normally,
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

    But I'm no autoconf wizard, and there may be dragons lurking there.

USE:

    You'll have to put your Mosso username and API key in $HOME/.cloudfuse
        username=[username]
        api_key=[api key]

    The following settings are optional:
        use_snet=[True to use snet for connections]
        cache_timeout=[seconds for directory caching, default 600]
        authurl=[authentication url, used mostly for testing]

    To run it, the syntax should be as simple as:
        cloudfuse [mount point]

    It also inherits a number of command-line arguments from the fuse
    framework.  The "-h" argument should provide a summary.

    Your OS user will need access to the "fuse" group.  This can probably be
    accomplished with:
        sudo usermod -a -G fuse [username]

BUGS/SHORTCOMINGS:

    * When reading and writing files, it buffers them in a local temp file.
    * It keeps an in-memory cache of the directory structure, so it may not be
      usable for large file systems.  Also, files added by other applications
      will not show up until the cache expires.
    * The root directory can only contain directories, as these are mapped to
      containers in cloudfiles.
    * Directory entries are created as empty files with the content-type
      "application/directory".
    * Cloud Files limits container and object listings to 10,000 items.
      cloudfuse won't list more than this number of directories/files.
    * Doesn't implement rename().  There's currently no good way to do this
      on the backend.  Unfortunately, this makes cloudfuse considerably less
      useful in Finder, as it expects to be able to rename a lot.
    * If libmagic is not available or it can't determine the mimetype of a
      file, "application/octet-stream" is used.

Thanks, and I hope you find it useful.
